	Algorithm:
	This function operates by taking the words it receives randomly generating possibilities

	This is done until the grid is above a given completion level.

	Return:
	This function returns a dictionary, in which ["grid"] is the grid, and

	where zeroes represent the slots that were not filled in, with the
	remaining slots containing a single letter each.

	Assumptions:
	Each possibility is a dictionary of the kind:
	p["word"] = the actual string
	p["location"] = the [i,j] (i is row and j is col) list with the location
	p["D"] = the direction of the possibility (E for ->, S for down)
